It's 2022. Trinidad and Tobago.
Pointe-Ã -Pierre, an industrial stretch beside an oil pipeline.
Oil infrastructure is central to the country's economy.
Five commercial divers worked for Paria Fuel Trading Company on repairs.
They wore standard diving gear and were removing an inflatable plug.
The pipeline had been cleared of oil nearly a month earlier.
Differential pressure existed inside the pipe but went unnoticed.
Work proceeded like any other afternoon...
Men joked and tightened bolts. Life seemed normal.
While removing the plug a vortex formed inside the steel tube.
Water and air roared and the men were sucked into the pipe.
Five divers vanished into the dark hollow of the pipeline.
Christopher Boodram survived by crawling for around three hours to safety.
He emerged, collapsed, and sought help with raw, exhausted hands.
Over the first weekend hope remained that air pockets might save them.
Rescue attempts were delayed because the air quality was likely poor.
A water pump was brought in and its lifting cable snapped.
External rescuers were reportedly blocked from intervening by Paria.
Paria admitted it had no rescue plan and claimed no legal duty.
A recovered GoPro recorded audio of the men praying and comforting each other.
The recordings capture voices, breath, and a steady, human fear.
Bodies were recovered over days: three on February 28 and one on March 3.
The Commission of Enquiry found Paria's conduct could be gross, criminal negligence.
It recommended the Director of Public Prosecutions consider corporate manslaughter charges.
In September 2024 charges were filed against Paria managers and the contractor.
The community watched the slow retrieval and the slow accountability.
Four men died inside a pipe while one colleague crawled out.
The company overseeing the work had no rescue plan.
