Hyperbaric chamber gaped like an industrial throat on a dim coastal worksite in Trinidad and Tobago, a thick pipeline vanishing into dark water; five divers' silhouettes are caught in frantic motion—four being dragged toward the pipe, their bodies half-obliterated by heavy black strokes and smeared oil-pastel color, one survivor crawling, bloodied and exhausted, reaching toward shore with a faceless, shadowed hand.
